# li3 Exercises

This Lithium project aims to take project and library documentation one step further by providing _interactive_ documentation, rather than just prose.

As such, this project is self-documenting. To learn about li3_exercises:

- Clone/download the project into your app/libraries or /libraries directory.
- Run `li3 learn`.

One example exercise is provided both as a use case, but also as an interactive tutorial to help new users understand how to create and use exercises.
